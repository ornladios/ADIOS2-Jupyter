# ADIOS2-Jupyter
ADIOS2 how-to examples on [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) running online on [My Binder](https://mybinder.org/)

Notebooks include examples for the full (low-level) and simplified (high-level) APIs.

Each branch maps to a target kernel environment.yml from anaconda, to access MyBinder click here for each environment and access the "notebooks" directory:

- [Python notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ornladios/ADIOS2-Jupyter.git/python) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ornladios/ADIOS2-Jupyter.git/python)   

- [C++11 notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ornladios/ADIOS2-Jupyter.git/cxx11) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ornladios/ADIOS2-Jupyter.git/cxx11)


Notes: 
- due to a matplotlib warning run Python notebooks twice the very first time
- reset C++11 xeus-cling kernels with the clean output option for a clean run every time
